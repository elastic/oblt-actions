## Missing tests for material behavior

Check whether changed behavior has meaningful deterministic coverage. Comment
when the diff adds or changes a material correctness, security, compatibility,
failure-handling, state-transition, permission, parsing, retry, concurrency,
build, or release behavior and no existing or new test would fail if that
behavior regressed. A bug fix should normally include a regression test that
fails for the original defect.

Before commenting, inspect the relevant existing tests, including higher-level
and generated-output tests. Do not request tests for documentation-only changes,
mechanical refactors with unchanged behavior, generated files whose source and
generation are already tested, or behavior already exercised at an appropriate
layer. Do not demand a unit test when an existing integration or end-to-end test
more directly covers the contract.

A missing-test comment must name the unverified behavior and a concrete scenario
and assertion that would catch a realistic regression. Do not leave a generic
"add tests" comment or prescribe test-file structure. When deterministic testing
is genuinely impractical, ask for specific reproducible verification evidence
and the reason it cannot be automated.
